# Quant

brief introduction:

This is a repository for my quant research, my plan is to use it to do python backtest for real quant trading strategy, also, do some data analysis job.

I have used this to finish a detailed statistical arbitrage strategy(considering all details, fees, slip point, holding time, stop-loss condiction), got positive results and running in the exchange simulation platform(SimNow) to do real market data test.

some snapshots of my work:

Figure_2.png in this repository (cant paste here)

the blue curve are the price change of two high related products's price delta( i just select two futures contracts which have different over date)

from the top to bottom, there are 3 straight lines:
top: up_bound, price go cross this will get sell signal
bottom: down_bound, price to get buy signal
middle: mean_value, from up(or down) to this line, will get close position signal

There are more details work in this repository. will add later.
